# /mailbox — Persistent Agent Memory

> Agents die. Knowledge survives. ψ/ remembers what ~/.claude/ forgets.

Team agents in Claude Code use ephemeral file-based mailboxes that die with the session. /mailbox adds a persistent layer in ψ/memory/mailbox/ — agents remember across sessions.

## Usage

```
/mailbox                                    # List all agent mailboxes
/mailbox read <agent>                       # Read agent's mailbox
/mailbox read-all                           # Read all mailboxes
/mailbox write <agent> "<subject>" "<msg>"  # Write finding to agent
/mailbox orders <agent> "<instructions>"    # Set standing orders
/mailbox load <agent>                       # Pre-load context for spawn prompt
/mailbox archive <agent> <team>             # Archive session end
/mailbox clear <agent>                      # Clear mailbox (→ /tmp, not deleted)
```

## How It Works

### Storage: ψ/memory/mailbox/

```
ψ/memory/mailbox/
├── scout/
│   ├── standing-orders.md          ← permanent instructions
│   ├── 2026-04-13_findings.md      ← what scout found (append-only)
│   ├── 2026-04-14_findings.md      ← next session's findings
│   ├── context.md                  ← saved working context
│   └── 2026-04-13_session-end.md   ← archive marker
├── builder/
│   ├── standing-orders.md
│   └── 2026-04-13_findings.md
└── auditor/
    └── standing-orders.md
```

**Why ψ/, not ~/.claude/?**

| Location | Owner | Lifetime | Purpose |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| `~/.claude/teams/` | Claude Code | Session only | Team config, ephemeral mailbox |
| `~/.claude/tasks/` | Claude Code | Session only | Task tracking |
| **`ψ/memory/mailbox/`** | **Oracle** | **Forever** | **Persistent agent knowledge** |

Claude Code's data dies with the session. Our data lives in the vault. Nothing is Deleted.

## Step 0: Run the Script

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/mailbox/scripts/mailbox.sh [command] [args]
```

The script handles all operations. Parse the user's `/mailbox` arguments and pass them through.

---

## Commands

### `/mailbox list`

Show all agents with mailboxes:

```
📬 Agent Mailboxes (ψ/memory/mailbox/)

  scout           3 files  orders: yes  last: 2026-04-13
  builder         1 files  orders: no   last: 2026-04-13
  auditor         1 files  orders: yes  last: never
```

### `/mailbox read <agent>`

Show an agent's mailbox — standing orders + latest findings:

```
📬 Mailbox: scout

  📋 Standing Orders:
    Always check security implications first. Report severity levels.

  📝 Latest Findings (2026-04-13_findings.md):
    ## Session 4 findings
    Found ghost agent bug in Claude Code...

  Total files: 3
```

### `/mailbox write <agent> "<subject>" "<content>"`

Append a finding to the agent's mailbox:

```
📬 Written to scout's mailbox: Session 4 findings
```

### `/mailbox orders <agent> "<instructions>"`

Set permanent standing orders for an agent. These are pre-loaded into every spawn:

```
📋 Standing orders set for scout
```

### `/mailbox load <agent>`

Output agent's context in a format ready to inject into a spawn prompt. Used by /team-agents when spawning agents with memory:

```markdown
## Previous Context for scout

### Standing Orders
Always check security implications first.

### Last Session Findings
Found ghost agent bug in Claude Code...
```

### `/mailbox archive <agent> <team>`

Mark session end. Called during /team-agents shutdown:

```
📦 Session archived for scout (team: whetstone-ops)
```

### `/mailbox clear <agent>`

Move mailbox to /tmp (Nothing is Deleted):

```
📦 scout mailbox moved to /tmp/mailbox-scout-20260413_104500
```

---

## Integration with /team-agents

### On Spawn (auto-load)

When /team-agents spawns an agent, it pre-loads mailbox context:

```bash
CONTEXT=$(bash ~/.claude/skills/mailbox/scripts/mailbox.sh load scout 2>/dev/null)
```

Injected into the agent's prompt so it starts with memory.

### On Shutdown (auto-archive)

When /team-agents shuts down, it archives each agent's session:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/mailbox/scripts/mailbox.sh archive scout whetstone-ops
```

### Standing Orders + Spawn

If scout has standing orders, every spawn includes them:

```
You are scout on team "whetstone-ops".

## Previous Context (from ψ/memory/mailbox/scout/)

### Standing Orders
Always check security implications first. Report severity levels.

### Last Session Findings
Found ghost agent bug in Claude Code. isActive() returns true always.
```

Scout starts every session knowing what it knows.

## Rules

1. **ψ/ is home** — all data lives in ψ/memory/mailbox/, never in ~/.claude/
2. **Append-only findings** — each session appends, never overwrites
3. **Nothing is Deleted** — clear moves to /tmp, not rm
4. **Standing orders persist** — until explicitly changed
5. **Load is cheap** — last 30 lines only, keeps spawn prompt small
6. **Agent identity = name** — same name across sessions = same mailbox
7. **No secrets** — never store tokens, passwords, or keys in mailbox
