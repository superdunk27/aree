# /vault - External Knowledge Connection

> "AI จะเก่งกับเราจริง ก็ต่อเมื่อมันได้เข้าถึงความรู้ของเรา"

Connect external knowledge bases so Oracle can think from ALL your accumulated knowledge, not just the current repo.

## Usage

```
/vault                                    # list connected vaults
/vault list                               # same
/vault connect ~/obsidian-vault           # register a vault
/vault connect ~/notes --name "personal"  # with label
/vault disconnect personal                # remove
/vault search "topic"                     # search across all vaults
/vault search "topic" --vault personal    # search specific vault
```

## Registry: `ψ/vault.json`

```json
{
  "vaults": [
    { "name": "obsidian", "path": "~/Documents/obsidian-vault", "type": "obsidian" },
    { "name": "notes", "path": "~/notes", "type": "markdown" }
  ],
  "updated": "2026-04-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## Mode 1: List (default)

Read `ψ/vault.json`. Display connected vaults:

```
📚 Connected Vaults (2)

  #  Name        Type       Path                          Files
  ── ─────────── ────────── ───────────────────────────── ──────
  1  obsidian    obsidian   ~/Documents/obsidian-vault    1,234
  2  notes       markdown   ~/notes                       89

  /vault connect <path>    — add a new vault
  /vault search "topic"    — search across all
```

If no vaults connected:
```
📚 No vaults connected.

  /vault connect ~/path/to/notes    — connect your first vault
```

## Mode 2: Connect

### `/vault connect <path> [--name <label>]`

1. Verify path exists and is a directory
2. Auto-detect vault type:

| Type | Detection | Special handling |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| `obsidian` | Has `.obsidian/` dir | Parse `[[wikilinks]]`, respect `.obsidian/app.json` |
| `logseq` | Has `logseq/` dir | Parse `((block refs))` |
| `markdown` | Default | Plain .md files |
| `notion` | Has Notion export structure | Handle nested folders |

3. Count .md files: `find <path> -name "*.md" | wc -l`
4. Auto-generate name from directory basename if `--name` not given
5. Save to `ψ/vault.json`

```
📚 Connected: obsidian (1,234 files)
   Path: ~/Documents/obsidian-vault
   Type: obsidian (auto-detected)
```

### Validation

- Path must exist and be readable
- Warn if path is inside current repo (use ψ/ instead)
- Warn if >10,000 files (large vault — search may be slow)

## Mode 3: Disconnect

### `/vault disconnect <name>`

Remove from `ψ/vault.json` with confirmation:

```
Remove vault "obsidian" (~/Documents/obsidian-vault)?
  (Only removes the connection — your files are untouched)
  [Y/n]
```

## Mode 4: Search

### `/vault search "topic" [--vault <name>]`

Search across all connected vaults (or a specific one):

```bash
# Search all vaults
for vault in $(cat ψ/vault.json | jq -r '.vaults[].path'); do
  grep -rl --include="*.md" "topic" "$vault" 2>/dev/null
done
```

Display results grouped by vault:

```
📚 Search: "oracle" across 2 vaults

  obsidian (3 matches):
    ~/obsidian/projects/oracle-notes.md (5 mentions)
    ~/obsidian/daily/2026-03-15.md (2 mentions)
    ~/obsidian/ideas/ai-collaboration.md (1 mention)

  notes (1 match):
    ~/notes/oracle-setup.md (3 mentions)

  💡 Read a file: just ask me to read any of these paths
```

### Context reading

After search, if user asks about a result, read the file directly:

```bash
# Read matched file for context
cat ~/obsidian/projects/oracle-notes.md
```

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | How vault helps |
|-------|----------------|
| `/trace --deep` | Include vault search results alongside ψ/ and git |
| `/learn` | Output study notes to a vault |
| `/recap` | Pull from vault's daily notes for context |
| `/rrr` | Reference vault learnings in retrospectives |

When these skills search for context, they should check `ψ/vault.json` and include vault paths in their search scope.

## Rules

- Never modify vault files without explicit user permission
- Vault paths are stored as-is (with `~`) — expand at search time
- Connection is one-way: Oracle reads from vaults, doesn't write to them (unless user asks)
- `ψ/vault.json` is committable — shared across sessions
