# /resonance — Capture What Resonates

When something clicks — log it. The pattern, the insight, the spark.

## Usage

```
/resonance                    # Auto-detect from recent conversation
/resonance "skills as marketplace"  # With explicit note
```

## When to Trigger

AI should consider auto-suggesting /resonance when user says:
- "yes!", "cool!", "very cool!", "love it!", "exactly!"
- "that's it!", "perfect!", "นี่แหละ!", "ใช่เลย!"
- Strong agreement after a design decision or insight

## Steps

### 1. Analyze Recent Conversation

Look back at the last 5-10 messages. Find:
- **What**: The specific idea, pattern, or decision that sparked the reaction
- **When**: Timestamp (from hook context or current time)
- **Why**: Why did this resonate? What problem does it solve?
- **How**: How was it discovered? What led to this moment?
- **Connection**: Does this connect to existing Oracle learnings?

### 2. Log to Vault

```bash
PSI=$(readlink -f ψ 2>/dev/null || echo "ψ")
mkdir -p "$PSI/memory/resonance"
```

Write to: `$PSI/memory/resonance/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_slug.md`

```markdown
# Resonance: [short title]

**When**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Session**: [session-id]
**Context**: [what we were working on]

## What Resonated
[The specific idea/pattern/decision]

## Why It Matters
[Why this clicked — what problem it solves, what it enables]

## How We Got Here
[The conversation path that led to this moment]

## Connection
[Links to existing patterns, principles, or learnings]

## Tags
[concept tags for future search]
```

### 3. Sync to Oracle (if available)

```
arra_learn({
  pattern: "[resonance title]: [what resonated]",
  concepts: ["resonance", ...tags],
  source: "resonance: [repo-name]"
})
```

### 4. Output

```
✨ Resonance captured: [title]
   → ψ/memory/resonance/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_slug.md
   Tags: [tags]
```

Short. Don't over-explain. The moment speaks for itself.

## Philosophy

> Resonance is the signal. When something resonates, it means
> the pattern matches reality. Log it before it fades.

Resonance logs are different from learnings:
- **Learnings** = what you figured out (head)
- **Resonance** = what clicked (heart)

Over time, resonance logs reveal what matters most — not what's logical, but what's alive.
